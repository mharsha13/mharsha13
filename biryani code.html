      <h2>About Biryani</h2>
      <p>
       A mention of biryani (or biriyani) is enough to make oneâ€™s mouth water and feel hungry. And when it is in front of you steaming and smelling nice, the tendency is to launch a vicious attack and devour it. That is how much we love biryani.
       </p>
      <p> Biryani is not something that can be whipped up in a trice. There is a very precise and long process of making it to get the best tasting product, not just for the most popular Hyderabadi biryani but the others too. When prepared well, it is nothing short of a work of art.
          </p>
          <p>
              Biryani is a meal in itself. There are several variations of this popular dish apart from the Hyderabadi. There are the Awadhi (or Lucknowi), Kolkata, Ambur, Dindigul, Thalassery, Donne, Bhatkali and many more.
              </P>
